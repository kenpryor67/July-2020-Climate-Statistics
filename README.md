# July-2020-Climate-Statistics
Climate report and datasets for Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network (CoCoRaHS) Station MD-FR-41, New Market 1.7 NW
Station Location:  Lat: 39.4090   Lon: -77.2997,   Elev: 443ft

Notes on datasets in this repository:

1. The daily weather observation log "July2020.txt" is a transcription of my written log shown in file "july2020.pdf". Temperature is measured in the Fahrenheit ("F") scale, rainfall is measured in inches.

2. "July_1970_2019.txt" is a 50-year long-term time series dataset titled "AN81m", for July 1970 - 2019, obtained from the PRISM Climate Group (https://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/), and adapted from the file "PRISM_ppt_tmin_tmean_tmax_stable_4km_onemonth_197007 201907_39.4009_-77.3009.xlsx".

3. The document "PRISM_datasets.pdf" contains descriptive material of PRISM climate datasets.

The notebook "July2020.ipynb" generates tables, descriptive statistics, and graphs of temperature and precipitation as compared to the long-term time series. Consists of four blocks that are executed in succession:

1. Read and build the daily weather observation dataset

2. Read and build the long-term climate dataset

3. Calculate descriptive statistics

4. a) Plot graphs comparing July 2020 statistics with long-term time series/means and b) save graphs as image files in .png format

Important results to note from this study:

1. Graph comparison shows that the July 2020 mean temperature (black dashed line) was greater than any monthly mean temperature (solid black line) during the period 1970 - 2019 and demonstrates that July 2020 was the warmest on record since 1970 here in New Market, MD.

2. 20 out of 30 days with a daily maximum temperature at or above 90 degrees F.

3. Extended heat wave occurred from July 17 - 30, 2020.
